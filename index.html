    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>High performance Computing intermediate.
    I graduated Masters in Technology from IIT Madras.
    My mission is to find difficult problems and make them run faster.
    The page should have blogs that someone someday may find inspiring.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">IBM Labs</a> [Current] I work in the Live Kernel Update team at IBM Labs where we've cut out the reboot to a complete kernel update.
      I focus solely on cross kernel migration of workloads through various hacks in different kernel subsystems. Ofcourse I make them run fast as well.</li>
      <lu><a href='#'>Amazon</a> [Internship 2023] I worked in fraud and byer risk assessment. I worked on an on-line fraud detection model. I raised automation rate from 0.39 to 0.51.
      and AUC from 0.61 to 0.83. Whereas the return offer was compelling, I chose to keep to my speciality. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">StarPlat MPI</a> My attempts at optimizing the distributed backend of a  multi backend compiler. [SOTA]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p> I often go through research papers in and around the field. This is a place I choose to vent out about them. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='#'>Kernel completions</a> Scheduler improvement for multi-threaded applications in the Linux Kernel</li>


    <h2>Contact</h2>
